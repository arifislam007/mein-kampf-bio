    <p>Mein Kampf (translated as My Struggle) is a book written by Adolf Hitler, first published in 1925. It is both an autobiographical account and a political manifesto, outlining Hitler's ideology and his plans for Germany’s future.</p>
    
    <p>The book is divided into two volumes. In the first volume, Hitler narrates his early life, his time in Vienna, and his experiences during World War I. He also details his growing anti-Semitic, nationalist, and anti-communist views, blaming the Jews for Germany’s problems, including the defeat in World War I. </p>

    <p>In the second volume, Hitler lays out his vision for Germany’s future. Central to his ideas is the concept of racial purity and the belief that the Aryan race is superior. He advocates for the expansion of German territory to create Lebensraum (living space) for Germans, especially through the conquest of Eastern Europe. The book also emphasizes his hatred of Marxism and his desire for a strong, authoritarian state led by a single leader (the Führer).</p>
    <p> Mein Kampf became the foundation for Nazi ideology and played a crucial role in shaping the policies that led to World War II and the Holocaust. The book is widely regarded as a dangerous and hateful text due to its promotion of racism and totalitarianism.</p>
